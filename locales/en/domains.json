Try adding a descriptive word (like \"get\", \"try\", or \"app\"), consider a different extension like .co or .io, or rethink the name entirely. Sometimes a taken domain leads you to an even better name you wouldn't have considered otherwise."

          "question": "Can I change my domain later?",
