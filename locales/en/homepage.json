You're always in control."

Your site stays online during the upgrade—no downtime, no complicated migration. And if you realize you upgraded too early? You can scale back down just as easily. No penalties, no hassle."

No chatbots trying to guess what you need. No outsourced teams reading from scripts they don't understand. Our average response time is about 2 minutes, and we stay with you until the problem is completely solved. Not just partially fixed—completely solved."

      "question": "I'm nervous about moving my existing site. Can you help?",
      "answer": "Absolutely, and we do this all the time. We'll handle the entire migration for you at no extra cost. That includes moving your files, databases, emails—everything. We'll also keep your old site running until we confirm the new one works perfectly. And if anything feels off after the move, we'll fix it immediately. You won't be left alone trying to figure this out on your own."
    },
    "commitment": {
      "question": "Do I have to commit to a long contract?",
      "answer": "No contracts, no commitments. You can pay month-to-month and cancel anytime. We do offer discounts if you pay annually, but that's completely optional—we never pressure you. We'd rather earn your business every month by doing good work than lock you into something you're unsure about. That's not how trust works."
